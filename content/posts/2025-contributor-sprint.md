[Open Source Stories](https://www.opensourcestories.org/) is a labor of love that celebrates people in open source and their experiences. We collect stories, perspectives, and journeys from people in the open source, preserving our history for future generations of contributors. Our core values reflect the core principles of open source, with an additional emphasis on  accessibility and inclusion.

We are launching this month-long sprint to scale our efforts and invite more collaborators and capture even more diverse stories. Our goal is to engage participants in collecting, recording, editing, and publishing Open Source stories.

We want **you** to join us in this first ever Open Source Stories sprint! This isn't your average open source project sprint. If you‚Ä¶have an interest in storytelling, enjoy refining and editing conversations, are enthusiastic about improving the contributor experience by building helpful tools and automation, or want to get involved in Open Source Stories in another way...

Fill out our [sign-up form](https://forms.gle/Dzuxnw8EATvqcaxY8) by **July 31st, 2025**! We will kick off the sprint on **August 11th, 2025**.

**What to expect:**

_Week 1_: Onboard participants and review sprint goals

_Week 2_: Conduct and record storytelling session / scope engineering work

_Week 3_: Transcribe and edit story content / review and iterate on new features or tools

_Week 4_: Review, publish, and promote stories / review and merge

If you‚Äôre curious about what we‚Äôve already done, we invite you to explore our [existing stories](https://www.opensourcestories.org/stories/), contributor guides, templates, and documentation outlining our process‚Äîfrom [recording storytelling sessions](https://www.opensourcestories.org/contribute/facilitator-guide/) to [publishing and sharing](https://www.opensourcestories.org/contribute/editorial-guide/) content to [improving the website](https://github.com/opensourcestories/opensourcestories.org/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). These resources will help you understand how we work, what‚Äôs expected, and how you can get involved at any level. We believe in transparency, collaboration, and learning as we go‚Äîso don‚Äôt hesitate to dive in!
